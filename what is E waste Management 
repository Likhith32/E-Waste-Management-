E-waste management using AI and ML involves the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to detect, classify, and manage electronic waste. This approach helps in automating the process of identifying various e-waste components like circuit boards, batteries, and displays. Computer vision models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are used to analyze images and sort items based on material type or device category. Machine learning algorithms can also predict whether a device can be reused, repaired, or needs to be recycled. This system reduces human effort, increases sorting accuracy, and improves recycling efficiency. Sensor-based smart bins integrated with AI can detect e-waste and trigger proper disposal actions. The collected data from these systems helps in analyzing e-waste patterns and planning better waste management strategies. AI-powered robots are also being used in recycling plants to automate dismantling processes. Overall, using AI/ML in e-waste management supports environmental sustainability and efficient resource recovery.
